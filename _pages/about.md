Welcome to my website! I am a PhD student in Political Science at the University of Colorado Boulder and a member of the Centre for Governance of Natural Resources at the Institute of Behavioral Science. I study environmental policy, development, and public policy in South Asia.


About me
======
Originally from Hyderabad, India, I moved to New Delhi in 2013 to pursue a Masters in Climate Science and Policy. Since then, I've been working on issues related to environment, social vulnerability, climate policy, and development. From 2016 to 2019 I worked as a Research Associate at The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), New Delhi on issues related to climate change adaptation and mitigation. My work took me to many field sites in India (especially in the Himalayan states of Uttarakhand and Sikkim) and Fiji, and I am indebted to these communities for their time and for shaping my research. My work has been published in Environmental Development, Science of the Total Environment, and the International Political Science Review.

Beyond research, I love travelling and photography (go check-out my [Photos](ganeshgorti.github.io/photos/)!). I also cook (a lot!) to keep my sanity, and I weild a badminton racket and a table tennis bat occasionally.
