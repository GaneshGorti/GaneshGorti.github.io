Welcome to my website! I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the [Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK)](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/en), where I specialize in political behavior and public opinion. My research examines trust in institutions, democratic attitudes, and risk perceptions, including how these are shaped by public policy in the areas of environment and development. My work has been published in journals such as Environmental Science & Policy and International Political Science Review. I hold a PhD in Political Science from the University of Colorado Boulder.


About me
======
I grew up in Hyderabad, a southern Indian city. In 2013, I moved to New Delhi to pursue a Masters in Climate Science and Policy. Since then, I've been working on issues related to the environment, climate policy, and development. From 2016 to 2019 I worked as a Research Associate at The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), New Delhi on issues related to climate change adaptation and mitigation. My work took me to many field sites in India (especially in the Himalayan states of Uttarakhand and Sikkim) and Fiji, and I am indebted to these communities for their time and for shaping my research. 

Beyond research, I love travelling and photography (go check-out my [Photos](/photos/)!). GO check this out.
