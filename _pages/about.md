Welcome to my website! I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the [Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change (MCC)] (https://www.mcc-berlin.net/en/index.html) in Berlin. I have a PhD in Political Science (Comparative Politics and Public Policy) from the University of Colorado Boulder. I study development and environmental politics with a specific emphasis on South Asia.


About me
======
I grew up in Hyderabad, a southern Indian city. In 2013, I moved to New Delhi to pursue a Masters in Climate Science and Policy. Since then, I've been working on issues related to the environment, climate policy, and development. From 2016 to 2019 I worked as a Research Associate at The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), New Delhi on issues related to climate change adaptation and mitigation. My work took me to many field sites in India (especially in the Himalayan states of Uttarakhand and Sikkim) and Fiji, and I am indebted to these communities for their time and for shaping my research. My work has been published in Environmental Science and Policy, Nature, International Political Science Review, Environmental Development, and Science of the Total Environment.

Beyond research, I love travelling and photography (go check-out my [Photos](/photos/)!). GO check this out.
